## About

RCL (Roger's Configuration Language) is a simple markup language that allows
for the generation of configuration files that can be easily processed by
various applications.

This repository will hold the tools needed to parse RCL

## Use Cases

RCL is intended to enhance projects by providing a simple configuration syntax
with an even simpler parsing process that returns a usable object in the
developers software projects.

I have used it for several reasons

- [x] Template configurations for modification of docx, pdf, xlsx, and other filetypes
- [x] Default Parameter definition for pythonic applications
- [x] Configuration of back-end data properties for web-applications
- [x] Code execution & build management

## Initial Support

RCL Parser currently supports

- [x] Python

Future state will include:

- [ ] Java
- [ ] C#
- [ ] C++
- [ ] Go
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Kotlin
